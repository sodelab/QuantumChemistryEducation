# QuantumChemistryEducation

Welcome to the **QuantumChemistryEducation** repository! This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and other educational resources designed for teaching and learning quantum chemistry and computational chemistry. The materials here are suitable for undergraduate and graduate-level courses, as well as for self-study by those interested in the field.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, and related files covering various topics in quantum and computational chemistry:
