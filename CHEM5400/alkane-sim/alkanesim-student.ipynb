    "## 1. Gas Phase Simulation Ethane\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will set up, run, and analyze a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for ethane in the gas phase. Ethane is a simple hydrocarbon, making it a good starting point for learning how to perform and interpret MD simulations. The tasks in this section will guide you through the key stages of a simulation workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. **Create and Load the Ethane Molecule and Force Field**\n",
    "   - First, you will create the molecular structure of ethane from a provided PDB file. The PDB file contains the atomic positions and bonding information necessary for the simulation.\n",
    "   - You will use the `PDBFile` function from OpenMM to read the ethane structure into the simulation environment.\n",
    "   - Next, you will create and assign a force field to ethane. A force field defines the potential energy function that governs the interactions between atoms (bonds, angles, torsions, and non-bonded interactions). In this case, you will use the **General Amber Force Field 2 (GAFF2)**, which is appropriate for hydrocarbons like ethane.\n",
    "   - You will load the force field into OpenMM, which will automatically assign parameters to the ethane atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. **Energy Minimization and Equilibration**\n",
    "   - Before running the simulation, you need to perform energy minimization. This process reduces any high-energy contacts that might make the system unstable during dynamics.\n",
    "   - Energy minimization is essential for finding a stable initial configuration by relaxing the molecule to its nearest local energy minimum.\n",
    "   - You will run a minimization algorithm and track how the potential energy of the system decreases as the molecule relaxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation**\n",
    "   - After minimization and equilibration, you will set up and run the molecular dynamics simulation.\n",
    "   - *Integrator Setup*: You'll use a **Langevin integrator** to simulate the system under constant temperature conditions (298.15 K). The integrator will help maintain the system temperature by simulating collisions with a heat bath.\n",
    "   - *Run the Simulation*: You will run the MD simulation for a specific number of time steps, allowing the ethane molecule to evolve over time. The simulation will generate a trajectory that shows how the atoms in the molecule move throughout the simulation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### D. **Trajectory Analysis**\n",
    "   - Once the simulation is complete, you will analyze the trajectory of the ethane molecule to understand its motion.\n",
    "   - Using `mdtraj`, you will visualize how the ethane molecule evolves over time and compute structural properties, such as bond lengths.\n",
    "   - For example, you will calculate the **C-C bond distance** between the two carbon atoms over the course of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### E. **Visualization of Results**\n",
    "   - Finally, you will visualize the results using matplotlib or another plotting library. This will allow you to observe how the energy and bond distances change over time during the simulation.\n",
    "   - You will generate a plot showing the **potential energy** of the ethane molecule as a function of simulation time, as well as the **C-C bond distance** variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this section, you will have a deeper understanding of how molecular dynamics simulations are performed and how to interpret the data generated from these simulations. This foundation will prepare you for more complex systems in future exercises.\n"
