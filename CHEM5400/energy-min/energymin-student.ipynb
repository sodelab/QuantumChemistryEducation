You will need to add in the coordinates of your molecule in order for Psi4 to know what all of the atoms are and where they are in relation to each other. Once you have the molecule built, you can use Psi4 to calculate different attributes of the molecule using the basis set that we specify. In this case we will use the Hartree-Fock method and the sto-3g basis set. (In Psi4, the Hartree-Fock method is denoted as SCF; in other packages, it is typically denoted as HF. SCF stands for Self-Consistent Field, which more generally specifies an approximation used in electronic structure methods.)\n",
