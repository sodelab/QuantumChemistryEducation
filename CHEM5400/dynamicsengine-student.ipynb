    "The RDF is important for phase identification and structural insight. The RDF reveals how particles are spatially arranged, indicating the presence of short-range order, clustering, or layering in the system. Different phases (gas, liquid, solid) exhibit characteristic RDF patterns. For example: the RDF for a gas is close to 1 for all $r$ indicating a random distribution, while the RDF for a solid shows sharp peaks of specific distances due to long-range order."
